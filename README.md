# Xarta

A command-line tool for organising papers from the arXiv. 

This is a lightweight tool that I use to organise my reading. Almost all of the papers I read are on the arXiv, and therefore there is no need for me to keep a local copy of my library on my machine.

Add a paper to your library and tag it by topic or project:
```
xarta add 0708.1344 --tag lepton-number-violation --tag effective-operators --tag neutrino-mass --tag neutrinoless-double-beta-decay
```

Now, `xarta browse` lists all of the papers in your library.
